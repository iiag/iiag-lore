Maximus Confucious Human, Born 793rd Year 

Was a Grand novelist and storyteller. 

A nomad dressed in shining and luxurious attir. He would travel 
the land explaining the beginnings and speech of creatures that 
only reside within ones dreams. His stories are extravagent and 
confusing filled with metaphors. 

He wrote many stories telling of great civilizations and grand 
champions that would slay terrible beasts. Unfortunatly he did not 
take these novels with him when he traveled. So if looked closely 
you find these ancient books.
