Introduction
============

The modern Gnat Language is typically divided into "High" Gnat and "Low" Gnat.
High Gnat is the literary language of the whole of the race, and the spoken
language in religious circles. Low Gnat is the common vernacular, and is used by
all, even sometimes among priests. It is occasionally written for more mundane
tasks, such as record keeping for food, troop numbers, etc. From a grammatical
perspective Low Gnat uses primarily a subset of the grammatical constructions of
High Gnat, with the addition of some irregular idiomatic constructions. The
vocabulary of both has some overlap based has diverged to a noticeable degree.
The proceeding text will describe the grammar of High Gnat and then take note of
how it differentiates from Low Gnat.

Script and Phonology
====================

Luckily the written language is (almost) always a direct reflection of the
pronunciation of the word it represents, so the construction of the
pronunciation of a word is entirely possible from its transliteration.

There are 4 vowels and 10 constants for a total of 15 vowels. Note that gnats
are not humans and therefore the international phonetic alphabet does not extend
to all gnat phonemes properly (international, not interracial). The following
are approximations. Furthermore note that as unicode has yet to add a code point
for gnat script, on the transliterations are described here.

|Transliteration | IPA Symbol | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
|  | /ɯ/ | Not written, found between adjacent consonants and before consonants with no following vowel. Often very short. |
| a | /a/ | |
| i | /ɪ/ | |
| o | /ʌ/ | |
| g | /g/ | Pronounced allophonically as /k/ at the end of a word. |
| G | /ɣ/ | |
| n | /n/ | |
| t | /t/ | This is never aspirated, unlike in English |
| f | /f/ | |
| r | /ɹ/ | Does not form a sylable with proceeding letter or implicit /ɯ/, can be a sylalbic consonant. |
| R | /ɰ/ | Sylabilizes like "r". |
| b | /b/ | |
| B | /b̪/ | |
| j | /ʒ/ | |

Sentence structure
==================

All sentences contain at least a single primary verb and optionally a number of
phrases that modify or specify that verb. Besides words that are considered by
themselves to be verbs, verbs can be formed formed from two adjacent nouns which
are bound by an implicit copula. The copula is in High Gnat written as "ara"
between the bound nouns, though it is not spoken in either and in Low Gnat it is
often simply written as "r" or not at all.

Gnat uses an adpositional particle system in order to demarcate grammatical
function beyond the verb of the sentence. These particles relate to a head of a
higher phrases, which is called the particle's radix. When a particle precedes
its radix it acts as an preposition, when it follows its radix.

For example, all of the following sentences can be translated as "All gnats are
mortal" (though the conveyed voicing may vary):

 * grf-an nn-ob gnat-an ij
 * gnat-an ob-nn ij an-grf
 * ij an-grf gnat-an ob-nn

Note the following vocabulary:

 * **grf** means "mortal" or "mortality".
 * **an** a particle marking a passive actor of a verb.
 * **nn** means "person", "creature" or "animate being".
 * **ob** is an particle meaning "all within" or "members of" with respect to a noun.
 * **ij** means "to be".
 * **gnat** refers to the race itself in this context.
