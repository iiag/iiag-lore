Introduction
============

Gnat is a subtle language, though its meaning is often clear. Most foreign learners can pick up enough of it to get by relatively quickly, but it is rare that a foreign learner ever achieve a complete understanding the complex intricacies that lie beneath its proverbial surface. As a foreign learner, try not to be dissuaded by the apparent complexity, coarse meaning is always easy, it is refining those coarse grains of meaning in a thin dust that can be mixed with water into a slurry and placed into all various crevasses of conversation that is the much more difficult task.

The modern Gnat Language is typically divided into "High" Gnat and "Low" Gnat. High Gnat is the primary literary language of the race, while Low Gnat is the primary vernacular. In more exclusive religious circles, the High Gnat can be a spoken language. Similarly, Low Gnat is sometimes written for more mundane tasks, such as record keeping for food, troop numbers, and the like. From a grammatical perspective, Low Gnat is primarily a subset of High Gnat, with the addition of some idiomatic, irregular constructions. While their vocabularies have notable overlap, there is certainly also a noticable divergence between them. The proceeding article will describe foremost the grammar of High Gnat taking note when necessary of how it differentiates from Low Gnat.

Script and Phonology
====================

Luckily, the written language is almost always a direct reflection of the pronunciation of the word it written, so pronouncing written text is relatively easy.

There are 4 vowels and 12 constants for a total of 16 phonemes in Gnat. Note that gnats are not humans and therefore the international phonetic alphabet does not extend to all gnat phonemes properly (international, not interracial), so the following are approximations. Furthermore note that as unicode has yet to add a code block for gnat script, only the transliterations are described here.

|Transliteration | IPA Symbol | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
|  | /ɯ/ | Not written, found between adjacent consonants and before consonants with no following vowel (which could be this vowel). Often very short. |
| a | /a/ | |
| i | /ɪ/ | |
| o | /ʌ/ | |
| g | /g/ | When found at the end of a word, pronounced allophonically as /k/. |
| G | /ɣ/ | |
| j | /ʒ/ | |
| f | /f/ | |
| n | /n/ | |
| k | /k/ | |
| t | /t/ | This is never aspirated, unlike in English |
| r | /ɹ/ | Does not form a sylable with proceeding letter or implicit /ɯ/, can be a sylalbic consonant. |
| R | /ɰ/ | Sylabilizes like "r". |
| b | /b/ | |
| B | /b̪/ | |
| s | /s/ | |

Sentence structure
==================

All sentences contain at least a single primary verb and optionally a number of phrases that modify or specify that verb. Besides words that are considered verbs intrinsically, verbs can be formed from two adjacent nouns which are bound by a silent copula. The copula is in High Gnat written between the bound nouns as "ara", while in Low Gnat it is often written as "r" or simply left absent. Both modern variants exclude the copula from pronuciation.

Gnat uses an adpositional system in order to demarcate the grammatical function of phrases beyond the verb of the sentence. These adpositions relate to a head of a higher phrase, which is called the adposition's radix. When an adposition precedes its radix it acts as an preposition, when it follows its radix it acts as a postposition. For example, all of the following sentences can be translated as "All gnats are mortal" (though the conveyed voicing may vary):

 * grf-an nn-ob gnat-an ij
 * gnat-an ob-nn ij an-grf
 * ij an-grf gnat-an ob-nn

Note the following vocabulary:

 * **grf** means "mortal" or "mortality".
 * **an** an adposition marking a passive actor of a verb.
 * **nn** means "person", "creature" or "animate being".
 * **ob** is an adposition meaning "all within" or "members of".
 * **ij** means "to be".
 * **gnat** refers to the race itself in this context.

As you may have inferred, not all adpositions can have all other types of words as a radix, for example *ob* binds to nouns only, which *an* only binds to verbs.

Verbs
=====

Verbs form the heart of the sentence. In the bare sense, the dictionary form, nothing is said about the tense, aspect or mood of the verb. Morphemes can be glued onto the verb in order convey these concepts. They act similarly to the adpositions described above, but do not bind to a radix. The morphemes can be attached to either side, but only one side at a time, though there are occasions in attempting to convey strange voicings where they can be found on both sides of the verb, but this is limited to rather obscure literary contexts.

Aspect
------

There are four aspects in the Gnat, the imperfective, perfective, partial perfective, and indeterminate. The foremost describes an ongoing or continuous aspect with respect to tense, the second describes completed actions, and the third describes actions which have yet to be completed. These first three are described by affixes. When no aspect is explicitly attached to a verb the aspect is said to be  indeterminate, meaning it is implied from the usage of the verb.

Aspect is marked by the following morphemes:

 * **kn** marks the imperfective.
 * **i** marks the perfective.
 * **ini** marks the partial perfective.

Tense
-----

There are four tenses in Gnat, past, present, future, and indeterminate. The past and future are marked explicitly while the present and indeterminate are implied. When there is no aspect marker and no tense marker the verb is said to be in the indeterminate tense. When there is an aspect marker and no tense marker the verb is said to be in the present tense.

Tense is marked as follows:

 * **bn** marks the past tense.
 * **bBn** marks the future tense.

Voice
-----

Voicing gives emphasis to one actor over another. The contrast between passive and active actors is expressed through which adposition is used to mark the actor, but the degree of activity of actors is expressed through word position. When an active actor is found on the same side of the verb as the affixed series of morphemes denoting tense and aspect, that actor is said to be strongly active or weakly passive. When the reverse is true the actor is said to be weakly active or strongly passive.

Nouns and adjectives
====================

Nouns and adjectives are not differentiated except in how they tend to be used. Words typically used with adpositions that give a nominal meaning are loosely considered to be nouns, and those used with adjectival adpositions are loosely considered to be adjectives. This is, however, not a binding contract. A word normally considered a noun can be used as an adjective and visa versa. As such, they are typically considered to be of the same word class.

Verbs can also be used in a noun sense, in which case they often refer to the act itself, or they can be used in an adjectival sense, in which case they take the radix they attach to to be their active subject. The latter case here can lead to complex and often ambiguous dependent clauses, and a pragmatical atlas often need be employed.

Note that Gnat does not have grammatical number when referring to nouns, unlike English.

Demonstratives and pronouns
===========================

There are demonstratives and pronouns that take the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person, but they have, like nouns, no differentiation because of number. Pronouns act like a word of the noun and adjective class. Demonstratives are used to refer to something near a person being referenced in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person. The following chart lists pronouns and demonstratives:

|             | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Pronoun     | ios        | iot        | iost       |
| Thing near  | Bos        | Bot        | Bost       |
| Person near | tios       | tiot       | tiost      |

Conjunctions
============

Conjunctions work by attaching conjoining morphemes to the words being joined. Conjunctions must be attached to both words and appear on the inside of the conjoined words such that the left word has a suffix and the right word has a prefix. While many do, some constructions do not attach the same affix to both the left and right word, and sometimes a conjoining morpheme can be used with different conjoining morphemes.

A list of conjunctions follows, unless noted, presume they are used with themselves:

 * **fo** combines clauses as "and" does.
 * **ab** used with *ba* marks the cause of a cause and effect relationship.
 * **ba** used with *ab* marks the effect of a cause and effect relationship.

Questions
=========

Questions are formed by attaching question affixes to a word. Question affixes are as follows:

 * **Ro** indicates an inquiry as to the specific nature of the affixee.
 * **oti** indicates an inquiry as to the truth of the affixee. While commonly used with verbs to form yes or no questions, it can also be used with nouns or adjectives to assert the validity of that noun in the given usage.

Note that *Ro* does not attached to the word *tnit* or the word *Bnit*, instead the words *tRo* and *BRo*. These words are treated as an unaffixed word, not as if *Ro* is attached to *t* or *B*.
